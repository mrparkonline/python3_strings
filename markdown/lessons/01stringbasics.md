# String Basics
---

Strings are our first sequence-like data type that we get to manipulate in Python.

### Strings

Strings are a data type in Python 3 that represent sequence of alphanumeric characters and special symbols. Strings will be enclosed with either ```'single'``` or ```"double"``` quotations marks to denote them as strings. You cannot mix match the quotations.

__Examples:__
- ```"a"``` or ```'a'```
- ```"1"``` or ```'1'```
- ```"0010"``` or ```'0010'```

### String Characteristics

- Variables can hold string type values: ```last_name = "Park"```
- A string value can be empty: ```string_variable = ''```
- A space is considered a non-empty string
- Strings are __comparable__; therefore, you can create boolean expressions when comparing strings
    - ```'Hello' == 'hello'``` evaluates to False because strings are also case-sensitive (also, the ascii value comparisons are different)
    
### String Comparison

Whenever a string needs to be sorted or compared, it follows the ASCII order.
- Numeric Symbols are less than uppercase characters
- Uppercase characters are less than lowercase characters

__Example:__


```python
# Comparing Strings

name1 = 'Jake'
name2 = 'Jane'

print(name1 < name2)
```

    True


__Explanation:__
The first two characters of the string are equal; however, we now compare the third characters of ```'k'``` vs. ```'n'```.

```'n'``` is considered greater than ```'k'```; therefore, ```'Jane'``` is considered __greater__.

__Determining the ASCII Value of a character__


```python
# Using the built-in ord() function

x = ord('A')
print('ASCII Unicode:', x)

print('ASCII Unicode:', ord('J'))
print('ASCII Unicode:', ord('a'))
print('ASCII Unicode:', ord('k'))
print('ASCII Unicode:', ord('e'))
print('ASCII Unicode:', ord('!'))
```

    ASCII Unicode: 65
    ASCII Unicode: 74
    ASCII Unicode: 97
    ASCII Unicode: 107
    ASCII Unicode: 101
    ASCII Unicode: 33


The ```ord()``` function allow us to see a single character's decimal value from the ASCII table. Our python interpreter will consider this value to help compare strings.

To do the reverse of ```ord()```, we can use the built-in ```chr()``` function to determine the character from a ASCII unicode.


```python
# Determining the character of a ASCII unicode

print('What is 42?', chr(42))
```

    What is 42? *


### Strings are Immutable

__Immutability__: The data type's value cannot be altered without recreation of the value stored in a variable.

A single character or multiple characters cannot be changed in a string without redeclaring, recreating, or updating the variable with the intended change.

_Integers, Floating Points, Booleans, and Strings_ are considered to be Immutable Data types.

__Example:__ Examine the error


```python
# Immutablity of String

name = 'Jim'
name[0] = 'T' # trying to change the first character of name: Jim to Tim

print(name)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-6-3c0ceba28a1c> in <module>
          2 
          3 name = 'Jim'
    ----> 4 name[0] = 'T' # trying to change the first character of name: Jim to Tim
          5 
          6 print(name)


    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
